The goal of this thesis is to create a memory efficient representation of
network host behavioural clusters used in the Cognitive targeted anomaly
detection framework. The used behavioural similarity measure does not form a
metric space. Therefore the non-metric cluster representation is needed.

Study the state-of-the-art literature on the topic of cluster representations in
non-metric spaces.

Create benchmark datasets and use them to compare the memory and computational
requirements of existing methods for cluster representations in non-metric
spaces.

Analyze the results, select the best method, and incorporate it into the
Cognitive targeted anomaly detection framework and fine-tune its parameters for
the network security domain.
